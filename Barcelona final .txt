Traditionally the food portions are small and unlike the United States, Barcelona’s biggest meal of the day is lunch! The food in Barcelona is not very expensive and could cost a traveler anywhere from 7 to 20 euros, being that lunch is far less expensive than dinner. Dinner is typically quite late and the most common hours to eat are between 9-11pm!<p>

<h3>Historical Attractions</h3>
<p>The Basilica of the Sagrada Familia is a monumental church devoted to the Holy Family; Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Construction began in 1882, based on plans drawn up by the architect Francisco de Paula del Villar, and Antoni Gaudy was commissioned to continue the project in 1883. The Temple has always been an expiatory church, built only from donations. As Gaudy said: “The Expiatory Church of the Sagrada Familia is made by the people and if mirrored in them. It is a work that is in the hands of God and the will of the people. 
<p> La Casa Battlo was designed by Antoni Gaudi and was previously the home to the Batllo family till Gaudi took it over to redesign in 1904. It is the center of Barcelona and is known for its unique design. The house was kept and managed by the Batllo children until 1954 when an insurance company acquired the building and set up offices there. The building is still a great site to see and apart of Barcelona’s history.</p>
